==================================================

Thank you for choosing ORLP - a high-performance platform for spased repetition learning.


INSTALLATION
------------

Please download & unpack zip-file under a Web-accessible directory. 


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by ORLP is that your Web server should be based on [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) or [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/download.html).


QUICK START
-----------

1. Open this project in your IDE;
2. Install [**Node.jsÂ®**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine). 

3. Install **npm** (the package manager for JavaScript) using the terminal of IDE by entering next command:
```
      npm install
```
4. Start the server by using the next command:
```
      npm start
```

Now you can work with the server. Last command will open the browser's window with running project.
