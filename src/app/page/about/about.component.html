      it to keep it in your memory. However, even the most familiar information will be forgotten if it is not
      encountered or refreshed for a very long time. In spaced repetition information is reviewed at gradually
      increasing intervals which decreases the rate at which information is forgotten</p>

  <p class="third-row-text mx-auto">On this Platform all learning material is divided into specific topics, such as
    programming languages, and are called categories. Each category contains courses which contain decks that are
    subject of repetition learning and should be completed over and over to consolidate material. Each deck contains a
    set of cards if the card is answered correctly then it will be marked to appear less frequently in the future,
    whereas if you get the answer wrong, the card will be set to appear more frequently.</p>
